# Hospital-Database-Management-System-HDMS-

Hospital Database that consists of many different tables, such as:
Doctors, Patients, Appointments, Insurance, Rooms, and Departments. The purpose of the healthcare database is to
improve the interactions between patients and their providers and store mass information that can be
used by the Hospital. The Hospital Database was programmed fully on Oracle SQL and the code was
tested/debugged on the terminal using SQL *Plus.

For you to use this, follow the "All Path file Commands," and that file will tell you to do what is in order.
To start, drop any tables that you already have in the SQL Plus because there could be a situation where
you have tables with the same name created already. You might get an error stating that you're trying to drop
a table that doesn't exist, which is a good thing because that means you don't have any tables named that - haha.

Then you should call the pathing file for the Create Table, Referential Integrity, Insert Data, and then 
you can query on that. You might get errors with the pathing since you'll need to change that based on 
where you downloaded the following files. However, once you've done that and no problems occur, then you can simply 
query the database with the MOCK data.

This Hospital Database is done the right way compared to others you'll see because I follow DBMS rules such as the 
given constraints for INSERT/DELETE/UPDATE, I'm organized with my files, I understand how to be mindful of naming conventions, etc.

You will see that I have constraints for everything, such as Primary Keys, Foreign Keys, Not NULL Constraints, NULL Constraints, 
Sequences, Check Constraints on the Sequences, and even Check Constraints on the boundaries of the Sequence. 

This project follows proper Database programming principles, so if you wish to have a great understanding of how to properly 
program Oracle SQL, to check out how I did each of my files while also doing your research.
