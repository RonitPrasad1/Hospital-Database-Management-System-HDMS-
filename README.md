# Hospital-Database-Management-System-HDMS-

Hospital Database that consists of many different tables, such as:
Doctors, Patients, Appointments, Rooms, and Departments. The purpose of the healthcare database is to
improve the interactions between patients and their providers and store mass information that can be
used by the Hospital. The Hospital Database was programmed fully on Oracle SQL and the code was
tested/debugged on the terminal using SQL *Plus.

For you to use this, follow the "All Path file Commands," and that file will tell you to do what is in order.
To start, drop any tables that you already have in the SQL Plus because there could be a situation where
you have tables with the same name created already. You might get an error stating that you're trying to drop
a table that doesn't exist, which is a good thing because that means you don't have any tables named that - haha.

Then you should call the pathing file for the Create Table, Referential Integrity, Insert Data, and then 
you can query on that. You might get errors with the pathing since you'll need to change that based on 
where you downloaded the following files. However, once you've done that and no problems occur, then you can simply query the database with the MOCK data.
